# Selfie-Non---Selfie

Categorizing a huge dataset available on the internet is a crucial task.Image processing is a
widely used platform in various fields ranging from facial detection, disease detection and many
more.To categorize the selfie images from a large number of images iS very tedious task in
image processing. Most of the existing researchers have already developed similar kinds of
applications for image classification. Sometimes few machine learning algorithms still have
issues of misclassification of wrong image instances.In this work, we propose a novel approach
to address the subtle problem of selfie detection for image database segregation on the web.
given the rapid rise in the number of selfies being clicked. In this model. we propose a selfie
image detection model from a heterogeneous image data set using a deep learning approach. A
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a model for learning from a customized dataset
consisting of selfie and non-selfie images and extracting features and learning through various
hidden layers. In the experimental analysis, we demonstrate how the proposed system provides
better classification accuracy than numerous machine learning algorithms. The system provides
classification accuracy of approximately 94% using our customized data sets
